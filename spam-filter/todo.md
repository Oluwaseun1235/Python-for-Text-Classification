# Text Classification with Python
How to improve our training and prediction model after "23 - Scoring Classifier Accuracy"


### Done
1. Binary Classification = spam vs not-spam


### Todo
1. Choose Vectors over One Hot Encoding
2. Use a neural network w/ Keras
3. Category Classification = good vs bad vs neutral vs hated vs loved


### Results
One Hot Encoding with SVM   = 88.25%
Vectors with SVM/Sklearn    = 
Vectors with Neural Network =
