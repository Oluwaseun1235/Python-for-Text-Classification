How to improve our training and prediction model after "12 - Train and Predict with Sklearn SVM"

1. More data
2. Choose Vectors over One Hot Encoding
3. Try other Classifiers in Sklearn
4. Use a neural network -- Tensorflow (w/ Keras) or PyTorch 


### Todo
1. Use a neural network w/Keras
2. Use larger data; process
3. Reusable prediction model
